The assignment was to clean up the html page. I feel pretty good about the html part, but I have some concerns with the CSS. There were several elements with the CSS that I thought were duplicating and redundant, but when I went to clean them up the layout on the page was breaking. 

I need to spend more time with CSS to fully understand what is going on with the properties.
